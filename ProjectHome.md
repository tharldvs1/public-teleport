Public Teleport is a Flash based videoconferencing system for the open source Red5 Flash server. The main idea behind this project is to create an application that allows high quality audio/video links between multiple venues.

The main features are:
- Simple, uncluttered desktop, ideal for projection on big screens.
- FLV video playback to play prerecorded video in all locations.
- Videos can be preloaded so bandwidth of live session is not affected.
- Remote control commands (Director mode).
- Control panel to adjust audio/video settings (screen resolution, framerate, bandwidth, audio  samplerate etc.).
- Loopback mode for soundcheck and latency testing.

While the frontend is based on Flash / Actionscript2, the backend is written in Java.
